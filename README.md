## Things that I want to do next:
### chessboard.py: ( hopefully i will be able to complete this by 2025 )
- [ ] add pawns on the board
- [ ] make the pawns move on click 

### house.py:
- [ ] add some colour to the house
- [ ] add some trees around the house
- [ ] make so that the user can pick the colour of the house 

### snakeGame_beta.py:
- [ ] make the game spawn more than 1 food at a time
- [ ] have certain number of hearts/lives
- [ ] add power-ups
